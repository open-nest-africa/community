## What is OpenNest-Africa?

OpenNest-Africa is a community that exists to:

- Provide a free, welcoming space for beginners to contribute to open source in a clear and direct way.

- Create accessible, beginner-friendly resources for anyone, regardless of background, to get involved in open source.

- Make knowledge-sharing, mentorship, and co-creation available and approachable for all.
  
This is not just a community — it's a nest. A place where ideas are nurtured, people are empowered, and growth is intentional.

## OpenNest Is Global

Despite our name, **OpenNest-Africa is not exclusive to Africa**.  
We are **led by African founders**, but we are **open to anyone** who aligns with our values of openness, community, and shared growth — no matter where you live.

---

## How We Work

We believe in:
- Open decision-making  
- Clear communication  
- Kindness, clarity, and collaboration over competition  

### Governance

We are currently stewarded by **four co-founders**.  
For any decision to be adopted, at least **two founders must be in agreement**. This ensures balance, fairness, and transparency in all we do.

A detailed governance charter will be published as we evolve.
